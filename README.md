# springFeignConsul

Two Restful services both register with consul on //localhost:8500

External Service:
Port:9098

Exposes Restful endpoints which then call the Internal Service asynchronously using the Feign HTTP Client.
GET /message
GET /message/{id}
POST /message
Message contains "id"(integer, autogenerated) and "message"(String) fields. e.g
{
  "id":"1",
  "message":"message text"
}

DELETE /message/{id}





Internal Service:
Port:9099

Exposes the same endpoints as the external service which are called by the external service. Uses a concurrent hashmap to store messages.
